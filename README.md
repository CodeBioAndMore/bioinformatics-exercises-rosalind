Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

Here you have the exercises that they propose on the page (highly recommended!): http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

And in this project you have some of the solutions that I have proposed.

🐍 It is the first time that I use Python, but it seems to me a good way to get familiar with the language and get fluent.

📌 I still have a lot to improve, but this page is a source of motivation and the responses of other users are a source of inspiration and knowledge.
